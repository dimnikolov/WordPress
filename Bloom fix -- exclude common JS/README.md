# WordPress Fix: Bloom plugin not working in Facebook and Instagram browsers

This plugin fixes a known bug in Elegant Themes' Bloom plugin. The plugin doesn't work on Facebook's and Instagram's built-in browsers on Android (WebView for Chrome) and on iOS (UIWebView for Safari). The error occurs on some devices (which I have managed to test on personally; this list is by no means exhaustive), such as Apple iPhone 7, and doesn't occur on others, such as the Huawei DIG-L01.

Big thanks goes out to Elegant Themes' fantastic support team -- and to Faisal H. from that team for providing me with the source code for this plugin.
