# WordPress Fix: Bloom plugin not working in Facebook and Instagram browsers

## What is this plugin?
This plugin fixes a known bug in Elegant Themes' Bloom plugin. The plugin doesn't work on Facebook's and Instagram's built-in browsers on Android (WebView for Chrome) and on iOS (UIWebView for Safari). The error occurs on some devices (which I have managed to test on personally; this list is by no means exhaustive), such as Apple iPhone 7, and doesn't occur on others, such as the Huawei DIG-L01.

Big thanks goes out to Elegant Themes' fantastic support team -- and to Faisal H. from that team for providing me with the source code for this plugin.

## How do I install and use it?
Download the 'divi-fix-exclude-common-js.zip' file from this repo.

1. In your WordPress admin panel, go to 'Plugins' > 'Add New' > 'Upload Plugin'.
2. A dialog box, prompting you to upload the zipped plugin, will show up.
3. Once uploaded, activate the plugin. You're done!

Last but not least, clear your Facebook and/or Instagram browser's cache -- and test if Bloom works as intended.
